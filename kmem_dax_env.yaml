# DESCRIPTION: Recipe to build a custom Grid'5000 environment on top of an
# existing pre-built one (such as one supported by the technical team).
# The recipe takes a environment name, and first extracts its image tarball
# before letting define some customizations in the setup section. It then
# export the new environment. This recipe does not rebuild the Grid'5000
# environment from scratch: neither the distribution installer nor Puppet is
# involved. The recipe must be built on a Grid'5000 node.
#
#==============================================================================
# This recipe extends another. To look at the step involed, run:
#   kameleon dryrun kmem_dax_env.yaml
# To see the variables that you can override, use the following command:
#   kameleon info kmem_dax_env.yaml

  ### Grid'5000 environment information
  ## (Uncomment and change any line if needed)

  ## Frontend to run kaenv3 on
  #grid5000_frontend: "frontend"

  ## Site used in the build
  grid5000_site: "grenoble"

  ## Environment to build from
  grid5000_environment_import_name: debian11-x64-nfs
  #grid5000_environment_import_user: "deploy"
  #grid5000_environment_import_version: ""

  ## New environment description
  #grid5000_environment_export_name: "$${kameleon_recipe_name}"
  #grid5000_environment_export_format: "tar.zst"
  grid5000_environment_export_description: "KMEM DAX Environment"

  ## Set where to store the environment and the assiated kadeploy URL base
  #grid5000_environment_export_dir: "$HOME/public/"
  #grid5000_environment_export_baseurl: "local://$HOME/public/"

  ## Optionaly, the environment postinstall script can be changed, e.g. to
  ## enable NFS homes, LDAP accounts, if not enabled in the imported env.
  grid5000_environment_export_postinstall_script: "g5k-postinstall --net debian --fstab nfs --restrict-user current"

  ## Optionaly, an additional postinstall can be given, e.g. to do some custom
  ## operations. Use the following variables to set the archive name and script.
  grid5000_environment_export_additional_postinstall_archive: "$${kameleon_recipe_name}-additional-postinstall.tar.gz"
  grid5000_environment_export_additional_postinstall_script: "pmem_setup.sh"
  ## The recipe will have to prepare the additional postinstall content in a
  ## directory to create in the local context and name "additional_postinstall"
  ## by default (next line to change it). The archive is created by the export.
  #grid5000_environment_export_additional_postinstall_dir: "additional_postinstall"

  ### Target machine/CPU architecture
  ## If building an environment for another architecture than x86_64, uncomment
  ## and adapt the next lines.
  ## The following works for ARM64 machines, just uncomment for such machines.
  #arch: aarch64
  #qemu_arch: aarch64
  #qemu_uefi: true

  ### You can add below any other global variable definition
  ## See the variables which can be overloaded, by running:
  ##   kameleon info kmem_dax_env.yaml
  ## Or define any new variable you would need. e.g.:
  #my_variable: my_value

  ### The bootstrap section takes in charge the import of the Grid'5000
  ## environment to customize. No modification should be needed here.
